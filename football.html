                   A football pitch (also known as a football field[1] or soccer field) is the playing surface for the game<br>
                   of association football. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game,<br>
                   "The Field of Play".[2] The pitch is typically made of natural turf or artificial turf, although amateur and<br>
                   recreational teams often play on dirt fields. Artificial surfaces must be green in color.<br>
                   <br>
                   All line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the<br>
                   touchline is still on the field of play, and a foul committed over the line bounding the penalty area<br>
                   results in a penalty. Therefore, a ball must completely cross the touchline to be out of play,<br>
                   and a ball must wholly cross the goal line (between the goal posts) before a goal is scored; if any part of<br>
                   the ball is still on or above the line, the ball is still in play.

                   Futsal (also known as fútsal or footsal) is a variant of association football played on a hard court,<br>
                   smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football.<br>
                   Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper.<br>
                   Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football,<br>
                   the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used.<br>
                   Futsal is also played with a smaller, harder, low-bounce ball. The surface, ball and rules<br>
                   together favor ball control and passing in small spaces. The game's "emphasis is on improvisation,<br>
                   creativity and technique"

                    In 2006, Garnier studied to become a football instructor and started a program of urban freestyle art<br>
                    gaining fame for his own style and skills. He was taught by the current world champion Benjamin Aw. In 2008,<br>
                    he was declared World Champion at the inaugural Red Bull Street Style World Finals in São Paulo, Brazil.<br>
                    Garnier combined music, breakdance, somersaults, various football and basketball elements to his routines.<br>
                    He formed his own team dubbed Street Style Society also called S3 Crew, which combines freestyle football,<br>
