                   Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.<br>
                   Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game<br>
                   are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).<br>
                   Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach;<br>
                   <br>
                   formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking<br>
                   the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court
