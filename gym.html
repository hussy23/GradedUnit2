                   A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for gymnastics, athletics<br>
                   and gymnastic services. The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium.<br>
                   They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and<br>
                   learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre",<br>
                   which is often an area for indoor recreation.

                    <br>
                    Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name, The Rock, is an<br>
                    American actor, producer, investor and retired professional wrestler. Johnson was a professional<br>
                    wrestler for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) for eight years prior to<br>
                    pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and<br>
                    over $10.5 billion worldwide, making Johnson one of the most successful and highest-grossing<br>
                    box-office stars of all time.<br>
                    <br>
                    Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, with whom he won a<br>
                    national championship in 1991. He initially aspired for a professional career in football and<br>
                    entered the 1995 NFL Draft, but he went undrafted. As a result, Johnson signed with the<br>
                    Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but was cut from the team in the middle<br>
                    of his first season. Shortly after, he began training as a professional wrestler.

                        The London fitness model has been competing since the age of 17 years old in competitions such<br>
                        as the Miami Pro in 2014. However, Andrei’s life hasn’t always been fitness and bodybuilding<br>
                        like many other professional athletes.<br>
                        <br>
                        There was a time he’d eat junk food and play video games all day long. His weight crept up and<br>
                        his confidence diminished. Andrei also suffered from bullying which only knocked him down further.<br>
                        <br>
                        Needless to say, Andrei’s now become one of the best fitness models in the UK. He continues to train<br>
                        and perfect his diet every day to make sure he’s the best version of himself.

                    Before becoming a bodybuilder and a personal trainer, Lazar Angelov played professional basketball<br>
                    for 10 years. He led his team in scoring for multiple seasons and was one of the best point guards<br>
                    of his class. At the age of 16 he joined the junior national team of Bulgaria and played for a<br>
                    couple of teams in the National Basketball Association of Bulgaria. At the age of 18 he<br>
                    spent an year and a half in the Army, where he found his vocation – bodybuilding.<br>
                    <br>
                    It became a constant part of his life and he went on to earn a certificate for a personal trainer from<br>
                    the National Sports Academy. Lazar started working with people, helping them to reach their<br>
                    maximum potential in developing their bodies.
