                   Basketball courts come in different sizes. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the court is<br>
                   94 by 50 feet (28.7 by 15.2 m). Under International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules,[1] the court is<br>
                   slightly smaller, measuring 28 by 15 meters (91.9 by 49.2 ft). In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely.<br>
                   The baskets are always 10 feet (3.05 m) above the floor (except possibly in youth competition).<br>
                   Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth<br>
                   three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points.<br>
                   <br>
                   The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at<br>
                   15 feet from the plane of the backboard. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while<br>
                   in play it is still worth 2 points
