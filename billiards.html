                   Pool is a classification of cue sports played on a table with six pockets along<br>
                   the rails, into which balls are deposited.[1][2] Each specific pool game has its own<br>
                   name; some of the better-known include eight-ball, blackball, nine-ball, ten-ball,<br>
                   seven-ball, straight pool, one-pocket, and bank pool.<br>
                   <br>
                   The generic term pocket billiards is sometimes also used, and favored by some pool-industry<br>
                   bodies, but is technically a broader classification, including games such as snooker,<br>
                   Russian pyramid, and kaisa, which are not referred to as pool games. In most parts of<br>
                   the world, it is commonly referred to as just "billiards", analogous to the term<br>
                   "bowling" being commonly used to refer the game of ten-pin bowling.

                    <br>
                    Growing up in eastern France, Kohler did not start playing pool until the age of 18,<br>
                    when he received a 6-foot pool table as a birthday gift from his parents.<br>
                    Kohler started watching exhibition videos online and trying to imitate shots in them.<br>
                    His influences include Mike Massey and Semih Sayginer.<br>
                    <br>
                    He began experimenting with his own versions of trick shots, and eventually developed many new<br>
                    concepts, such as ball jumping, massé-ing with multiple cues simultaneously, executing<br>
                    jump and massé shots on moving balls, and executing very high jumps. He has set<br>
                    a record for highest jump shot on a moving ball, at 34 inches (86 centimeters).
