                   Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two players on a sand court divided<br>
                   by a net. As in indoor volleyball, the objective of the game is to send the ball over the<br>
                   net and to ground it on the opponent's side of the court, and to prevent the same<br>
                   effort by the opponent.<br>
                   <br>
                   Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and<br>
                   individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making<br>
                   a block touch (the block touch counting as one touch, leaving only two more<br> 
                   touches before the ball must be hit over). The ball is put in play with a serve—a<br>
                   hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents.

                   The complete set of rules are extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player<br>
                   on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then<br>
                   hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net,<br>
                   and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be<br>
                   grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players<br>
                   may not touch the ball twice consecutively.
