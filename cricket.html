                   A cricket field is a large grassy field on which the game of cricket is played. Although<br>
                   generally oval in shape, there is a wide variety within this: some are almost perfect circles,<br>
                   some elongated ovals and some entirely irregular shapes with little or no symmetry – but they<br>
                   will have entirely curved boundaries, almost without exception.<br>
                   <br>
                   There are no fixed dimensions for the field but its diameter usually varies between 450 feet<br>
                   (137 m) and 500 feet (150 m).<br>
                   Cricket is unusual among major sports (along with golf, Australian rules football and baseball) in<br>
                   that there is no official rule for a fixed-shape ground for professional games. On most grounds,<br>
                   a rope demarcates the perimeter of the field and is known as the boundary. Within the boundary and<br> 
                   generally as close to the centre as possible will be the square which is an area of carefully<br>
                   prepared grass upon which cricket pitches can be prepared and marked for the matches.

                   Futsal (also known as fútsal or footsal) is a variant of association football played on a hard court,<br>
                   smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football.<br>
                   Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper.<br>
                   Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football,<br>
                   the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used.<br>
                   Futsal is also played with a smaller, harder, low-bounce ball. The surface, ball and rules<br>
                   together favor ball control and passing in small spaces. The game's "emphasis is on improvisation,<br>
                   creativity and technique"

                        In terms of the concept of the game indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin,<br>
                        indoor cricket involves two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler bowls the<br>
                        ball to the batsmen who must score runs. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins.
