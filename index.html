                         For one, you may never be aware of it, but the energy being exerted by people who have done even the simplest<br>
                         walk or jog or run for a few significant minutes can actually energize us and give us certain "high" and<br>

                    Football involves running, sprinting and drills that require generous energy expenditure and engage<br>
                    the cardiovascular system. Regularly participating in aerobic exercise such as football offers <br>

                    Basketball is a contact sport, and it requires a large variety of skill development. <br>
                    When conditioning for basketball, players need aerobic and anaerobic training. Aerobic training involves<br>
                    endurance, and anaerobic training involves short burst activities. During playtime, there is a lot of<br>
                    starting and stopping, so while it is not considered an aerobic sport, it still provides a heart-pumping <br>

                         Playing sports is a great way to stay fit and healthy, mingle with people, and have lots of fun. In order to make the most<br>
                         out of it, however, people need to practice regularly â€“ and in order to be motivated to practice regularly,<br>
                         they need to fully enjoy the experience. This can only happen if theyâ€™re able to play their favorite sport<br>
                         in comfort and safety, at a convenient time and place. When people can practice any sport they want,<br>
                         any time of the year, in an optimal environment, theyâ€™re sure to frequent the athletic facility<br>
                         that provides them with the enjoyable experience.<br>
                         <br>
                         Despite the many advantages of outdoor sports facilities, such as space and natural light, indoor complexes offer<br>

                    Volleyball is an excellent cardiovascular exercise. It involves running, jumping, hitting and even squatting<br>
                    which will get your heart pumping and your lungs going. Getting your heart rate up will result in the<br>
                    efficient circulation of blood and other nutrients throughout your body, which improves your overall health.<br>
                    Playing volleyball regularly helps keep your heart healthy which in turn helps to prevent diseases such as<br>
                    cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes.
