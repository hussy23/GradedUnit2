                   A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool is<br>
                   a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities.<br>
                   Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground<br>
                   (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure),<br>
                   and are also a common feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships.
                   <br> 
                   In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete,<br>
                   natural stone, metal, plastic, or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape<br> 
                   or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool.
